A free collection of icons for map markers.
Creative Commons by Nicolas Mollet & others.

You can download more markers from
http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com

Use them by setting DEFAULT_MARKER in your settings.py or by assigning them
to your categories or subcategories.

To use the default ones use the path 'macadjan_base/markers/icons/<icon_name>.png

You can use your own markers by putting them in your theme dir (in a folder called
'markers'), and by using the path 'themes/<your_theme>/markers/<icon_name>.png
